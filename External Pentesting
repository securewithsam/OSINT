	  (Note: While using trevorspray make sure to use multiple AWS instances so we get different public IPs to 
    spray pwds ,and not get locked out by just doing all from one IP and before initiating the trevorspary make sure 
    to login /ssh into all those VMs and accept the fingerprint (Y)and then initiate the trevorspray )
